 🧩 Maze Runner — Console Game in C++

A simple and fun console-based Maze Runner game built in C++ as a first semester project.

In this game, the player must navigate from the **Start (S)** to the **End (E)** without hitting any walls (`X`). You can move using the **W/A/S/D keys**. If you reach the end, you win!
